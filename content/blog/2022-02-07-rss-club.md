I've been meaning to set this up for a while, but this marks the inaugural post, and explainer, for the rss club posts on here.

The idea originated from Dave Rupert and is explained better than I could explain in his write up: [Welcome to RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/)

As he states in his write-up, there are three rules:

1. Don't talk about RSS club
2. Don't share on social media
3. Provide value

I can't promise I'll be adding value, but as I move to writing more freely here and trying to limit my engagement on Twitter, there'll certainly be something different for RSS only readers that the plebs will be missing.

If you do happen upon this, feel free to send a knowing wink my way or attempt a secret handshake should we meet in person.
