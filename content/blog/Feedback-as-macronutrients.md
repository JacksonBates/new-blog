I've been reading Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen's "Thanks for the Feedback" on and off for a couple of years. I keep coming back to it. A thing that stuck out to me again on a recent re-read was their framework distinguishing between appreciation, coaching, and evaluation style feedback. They make the point that one source of friction in the feedback process is a misalignment between the giver's and receiver's expectations and intentions regarding these types.

That does really resonate with me, but it also sparked a different categorisation in my mind, probably because I've been thinking more about my health goals and strength training now that I have a new obsession with rock climbing. My new framing got me mapping feedback types to macronutrients. As an Engineering Manager, this metaphor has helped me think more clearly about the balance of feedback I both give and receive. And as a former English teacher, I absolutely love a tortured metaphor...

## The Nutritional Components of Feedback

### Carbohydrates: Recognition and Affirmation

Just as carbohydrates provide our bodies with immediate and necessary energy, positive observations and affirmations fuel our day-to-day motivation. These acknowledgements of what we're doing well might include recognition of successful project deliveries, appreciation for collaboration efforts, or noting improved skills. This maps pretty closely to Stone and Heen's appreciation feedback type.

In my team, carbohydrate feedback sounds roughly like:

* "Your refactoring of the authentication module made our codebase significantly more maintainable."
* "I appreciated how you facilitated that difficult conversation between design and backend."
* "The documentation you created has already helped onboard two new team members."

I should point out that I'm a strong believer of the idea that feedback needs to be really specific. I'm sure books like *Thanks for the Feedback* state that explicitly (I don't have a quote to hand and won't look it up), but it's worth underscoring that it's fairly commonly accepted you can't just say "Good job!" and think that's successful feedback delivered. If it's not specific, it just doesn't ring true - and it might lead folks guessing exactly what part of the job was in fact good!

Like dietary carbs, these aren't just "nice to have"; they're essential. Without regular positive reinforcement, teams experience an energy deficit, finding it harder to sustain momentum and engagement.

### Protein: Constructive Criticism

If positive feedback fuels us, constructive criticism builds us. Protein feedback is specific, actionable, and focused on behaviours or skills that can be improved. It leads to incremental growth in existing capabilities and typically comes with clear action items. Similar to actual protein rich foods, you can't just ingest critical feedback and automatically see gains - you have to do some work with it too.

As a manager, protein feedback I might offer includes:

* "Your code reviews would be more effective if you asked questions instead of making statements when suggesting changes."
* "Your technical documentation lacks user context. Try adding a 'Why' section at the beginning."
* "In stakeholder presentations, you could strengthen impact by opening with the business value before diving into technical details."

*Note* - there are better ways to offer feedback than these above. This is just an illustration of the kind of thing you are likely to hear or say.

Like dietary protein, this feedback directly contributes to building strength in specific areas. Without it, development stagnates, regardless of how much positive reinforcement is present.

### Fats: Perspective-Shifting Insights

Historically the most misunderstood macronutrient? Maybe. Fats are nonetheless essential for long-term health. Similarly, perspective-shifting feedback might initially seem abstract, weighty, or even uncomfortable, but it provides the insights that sustain us through challenging situations and build our adaptability.

Fat feedback doesn't necessarily come with immediate action items. Instead, it questions fundamental assumptions, worldviews and mindsets, often taking longer to process but ultimately providing deeper nourishment.

I know. I know. I am really torturing this metaphor now.

As a manager, perspective-shifting feedback I might offer:

* "Your technical decisions show you're optimising for elegant code rather than business impact. Consider what would change if you prioritised the latter."
* "You seem to view coding as primarily a solo activity. What might change if you approached it as a collaborative, communication-centred practice?"
* "The discomfort you feel with ambiguity isn't something to overcomeâ€”it's actually a valuable signal you should pay attention to."

Like essential fatty acids, these insights don't provide immediate energy but are crucial for long-term resilience and health. They help us navigate complexity and uncertainty by building a more nuanced understanding of our professional landscape.

## Balancing Your Feedback Diet

Just as nutritional needs vary by individual and circumstance, feedback requirements differ across career stages, roles, and personalities. A junior engineer might need a higher proportion of protein feedback to build capabilities quickly, while a team navigating significant change might benefit from fat-rich perspective shifts.

As an engineering manager, I'm now thinking more consciously about the macronutrient balance in the feedback I provide:

* **Am I providing enough daily fuel** through recognition and positive observations?
* **Am I offering protein-rich constructive criticism** that helps build specific capabilities?
* **Am I including the essential "fats" of perspective-shifting insights** that challenge fundamental assumptions and build resilience?

Also, I try to be mindful of the feedback I seek and consume. When I find myself resistant to certain types of feedback, I consider whether I'm avoiding an essential nutrient my professional development requires.

The next time you're preparing for a performance review, a 1:1 meeting, or any feedback conversation, consider the macronutrient balance you're providing. Are you offering empty calories, or a balanced diet that will truly nourish growth?

And equally importantly, consider your own feedback intake. Are you consuming a balanced diet, or favouring certain nutrients while neglecting others?

Sometimes you just want to gorge on bread and potatoes, but that has to be your sometimes-treat.
