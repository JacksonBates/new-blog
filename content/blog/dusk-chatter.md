It only recently occurred to me that different bird sounds and behaviours were worth paying attention to.

The local Cockatoos have been extremely noisy on my evening walks recently. They had been finding plenty of pine cones and seed pods to eat around my way, so they've been visiting in massive flocks. Their screeching has been a near constant back drop as the sun begins to set.

But this evening, I saw and heard them behaving differently.

They were flying in pairs and trios, sort of hopping between trees in turn. One flies to tree A, then the next lands in B, the third goes to C, and the one from A moves on to another, and so on.

Coupled with that, their screeches were somewhat replaced with a two-tone 'Rraa-Rraaap' sort of sound.

It was interesting to hear, because it seemed more conversational or situational than the usual racket. I'm imagining it's something like 'No food here, what about you?' or some other observation they're tracking together.

Obviously, I'm speculating wildly, but it brightened up the walk a bit trying to tune in to it and eavesdrop on them.
