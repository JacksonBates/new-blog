## Testing Forestry

I've been wanting to write more, but find the need to use my laptop too cumbersome to bother with most of the time.

I wondered how it would be possible to write this blog from my mobile. It's a Jekyll site hosted via github pages, so obviously there's no CMS editor to work with. I toyed with the idea of editing raw files in GitHub, but quickly decided against.

There are some solutions available, though.

My first attempt was with an open source tool called [prose.io](https://prose.io). That offers a web editor, but I found it clunky to us on mobile.

For some reason I couldn't uncover, it also wouldn't let me save my completed post...

So my second attempt, this one, is authored with Forestry. This one has a cleaner editor, and was clearly made with mobile in mind.

So far, it seems very decent, but I've noticed that two builds failed while I was writing... Presumably that was my front-matter configuration commits.

It will remain to be seen as to whether or not this deploys without incident...
