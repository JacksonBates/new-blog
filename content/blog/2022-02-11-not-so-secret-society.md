So it turns out that I was leaking the existence of the super secret RSS Club in the extra affordances my blog theme, Chirpy, provides.

There's related posts and next / prev navigation panels at the bottom of the page, and I wasn't hiding the existence of the RSS only posts from them.

Since I only dabble in Jekyll very occasionally, and dabble in Liquid templating even less, it took me a little while to figure out how to filter them out.

I will say, I don't hate Liquid. Piping stuff through a series of filters is quite elegant, really.

But I'm pretty glad I don't work in it every day ðŸ˜…

Anyway, I'm now hiding all the clues pointing to the existence of the RSS only posts that I could find.
